# Scrum Events

Scrum guide calls these events, while Scrum alliance calls these activities.

1. Spring planning
2. Daily Scrum
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective
5. Product Backlog Refinement
    - Scrum alliance adds this activity.

All of these are an opportunity to inspect and improve processes.
All of these take place in the context of a sprint which will last less than a month.

Every sprint should result in a potentially shippable product increment

Event durations expand and contract with sprint duration, with the exception of the daily scrum which is always 15 minutes.

For a 1 week sprint, spring planning would be 2 hours. For a 4 week sprint, planning would be 8 hours.

## Sprint planning

### Meeting inputs

- Ordered product backlog
  - So you know what remains to be done
- Record of completed items
  - So you know what has already been completed
- Knowledge of past performance
  - A gauge of how much you can get done in this sprint
- Dev team capacity for the sprint

### Two main questions

A sprint planning meeting always needs to answer two main questions.

- What will we do?
- How will we do it?

The PO submits back log items to the team, and the team decides which items should come into the sprint.

### Meeting outputs

- Sprint Goal and what will be completed (PBIs)
- How the work will be done (Plan)
- Sprint Backlog

## Daily Scrum

The Scrum master doesn't even have to attend this meeting if it's not needed.
BUT
The scrum master is responsible for ensuring it happens each day and that it does not exceed
the fifteen minute time box.

### Guidelines

#### Attendance according to Scrum Guide

- Team member attended and facilitated.
- Not attended by the scrum master. Only ensures it happens and that it's < 15 minutes.
- PO does not participate.

#### Attendance according to Scrum Alliance

- Entire scrum team attends daily scrum
- Any team member can provide updates
- Any interested party can attend, so long as they DO NOT contribute.

#### Conduct

- Scrum master does not conduct the event. They only ensure it takes place and is effective
  - It should not last too long, and should accomplish the teams goals.

#### Questions

Each team member should answer these three questions

- What did I do yesterday to help meet the sprint goal
- What will I do today to help meet the sprint goal
- What are my blockers to helping meet the sprint goal

## Backlog refinement

__Only scrum alliance calls for this event. Not Scrum Guide.__

Backlog refinement can mean two things

1. An ongoing process whereby the PO gets more information about the needs and requirements for the product.
2. It's an actual meeting the team has after the midpoint of the sprint.
    - In a two week, or ten day sprint, the instructor targets this meeting for days 5, 6 or 7. This is usually late enough that PBIs are in the correct order, but gives the PO enough time to update PBIs with any additional information from clarifying questions from the team.

### Event

#### Agenda items

- PO Presents candidates for the next sprint.
  - User stories etc.
- Dev team asks questions and gets clarification on items.
  - This is actually the dev team giving the PO guidance one what additional info is needed to get the PBI ready for the next sprint.

### What makes an item ready

- Can be completed in a single sprint.
- Up and down stream dependencies are identified so they can be managed
- Story has been sized by the dev team to know about how long it will take to complete
- Acceptance criteria are defined so the team knows what done is for the story

## Sprint Review

Second to last event. Usually scheduled for the afternoon of the last day of the sprint.

This event is meant to be informal. The focus is on collaboration.

### Agenda Items

- Overview of goals and PBIs in the sprint
- Dev team demo's the product increment. They can also share challenges and solutions encountered during the sprint. Gives the business an idea of what the team has done and what it took to get there.
- PO shares the product backlog and the next set of ordered PBIs. They can also share a projection of current progress against total project completion.
- PO encourages open discussion with stakeholders. Stakeholders may present outside information that may help the scrum team evaluate the best course of action going forward. Things like intelligence about competitors products, etc.
- PO Adds feedback into the backlog.

For a twi week sprint, review should last about two hours.
Generally the PO hosts this event, and the SM ensures that all involved understand the value proposition, and that the meetings stays properly time boxed.

## Retrospective

This meeting is focused on the team, not the product

The output is a list of things the team can do to improve the next sprint

### Potential areas of focus

- How everyone worked as a team
- Health of team relationships
- Collaboration
- Processes and tools functionality

### Questions to ask

- What went well during the sprint
- What didn't go well in the sprint

Once these are out in the open the team will create a list of things to focus on improving, or work on maintaining in the next sprint.

The list could be long, but instructor recommends only working on one or two in the next sprint.
Improvement items should never intrude on the main focus of the next sprint, the product increment.

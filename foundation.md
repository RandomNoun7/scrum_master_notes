# Foundation

Scrum is just one Agile framework.

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

Shift from believing that the process is valuable to valuing the end product.

## 12 Principles

### Categories

1. The customer and how customers and teams interact.
2. The team and how its members are selected and how it functions.
3. Product and process or how agile teams produce the best product.

## Scrums value

1. It's lightweight
2. Easy to understand
3. Hard to master

## Empirical Process Control

Processes are based on empirical learning

3 pillars

1. Transparency
    - All aspects of how a team does its work must be visible to all team members
    - All team members must agree on how to do the work, what work needs to be done, and what done means
2. Inspection
    - Teams should frequently asses the work they are doing and whether they are moving closer to the goal.
3. Adaptation
    - If teams are not moving closer to goal, they will adapt their processes to change direction and ensure progress.

## Events

Four events drive the empirical process

1. Sprint planning
2. Daily scrum
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective

## Values

The pillars are backed by the scrum values of

- commitment
- courage
- focus
- openness
- respect

These values help establish trust on the team. Trust makes it safe to explore, experiment, learn, and solve difficult problems.

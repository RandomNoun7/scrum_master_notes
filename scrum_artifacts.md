# Scrum Artifacts

## Product Backlog

An ordered list of all the work that still needs to be done for the product

Anyone can add items to the backlog, but only the PO can decide on their value.

Only the dev team can estimate effort.

## Sprint Backlog

The subset of PBIs that the team has selected for inclusion in the sprint.

The PO orders the backlog to ensure the highest value items are at the top.

In sprint planning the PO presents the items the PO WANTS in the sprint. But only the dev team, as the ones doing the work, can choose which items to include in the sprint backlog. The dev team is best suited to identify the items that will create a product increment.

Only the development team can change the sprint backlog during the sprint.

## Backlog Ordering

1. Backlog refinement. An ongoing process whereby the PO and/or delegates refine the requirements for the product.

The scrum master is tasked with ensuring the PO keeps on top of backlog ordering.
Also ensures the dev team provides input to ordering to ensure things are done in the right sequence.

## Product increment

Teams should deliver a working product increment at the end of each sprint. This ensures the work is done iteratively and narrowly.

### Requirements

1. Must meet the teams definition of done
2. Must meet the PO's criteria
3. Must meet the value envisioned in the sprint goal

All three must add up to working software.
It must also still be relevant to market needs to be releasable. PO will then decide if now is the time to release the product increment.
Documentation is considered a part of the criteria for done.


## Definition of done

Acceptance criteria apply for only the PBI they are written for. A definition of don (DoD) applies to all PBIs for a team.

If a PBI has an acceptance criteria of 'should accept user input', a team DoD may say something like that 'All user inputs should be sanitized before processing'.

#### Some examples of DoD criteria

1. The dev has unit tested the feature.
2. All acceptance criteria have been met.
3. Regression tests have been completed.
4. Code has been reviewed by another developer.

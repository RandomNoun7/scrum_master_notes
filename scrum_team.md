# The Scrum Team

## The role

A scrum master is not the project manager.

The scrum master helps the product owner stay on track by

- Helping ensure the back log is updated and ready for the next sprint
- Ensures the sprint is appropriate. The PO should not demand too much from the team

Scrum master helps the dev team perform. They..

- Protect the team from outside distractions. The SM is aware of what team members are supposed to be doing right now and runs interference if a manager wants to ask team members to do anything that is outside of th product backlog.
- Protecting the team from overwork and burn out. Protecting the team from itself sometimes.
- Prevents complacency. When teams work together for a while they may stop looking for ways to improve their processes and interactions. They may also under commit their sprints.

Scrum master also owns the scrum process itself.

- Owns the scrum framework.
- Accepts input from the team, but the process itself ultimately belongs to the scrum master.

## Servant leader

- The scrum master is the leader and owner of the overall scrum process.
- Responsible for educating the dev team, the PO and the business on scrum processes and values.

Your not focused on being the best and brightest, you are focused on helping the team and its members be the best they can be.

Helps the PO clarify goals and objectives. Ensures the work that comes to the team is in the best condition possible.

- Conflict Resolution
  - Process

  - Not so many the team can't keep them straight.
  - Establish a few and work from there.

## Working Spaces

This part of the course feels a little bit stale in the context of the pandemic. Hopefully it will be fully applicable again soon, but as a fully remote employee the assertion that all teams should be co located if possible is still not something I can fully get behind.

However, the course does acknowledge that this is not always possible physically, even with a team that is co located, and many teams are simply hybrids of co location and remote. In those cases both 'caves' and 'commons' can be used for the conflicting needs of collaboration and concentration, and a mix of physical presence and online collaboration tools may be required for remote team members.
